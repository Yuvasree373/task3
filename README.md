# Linear Regression Analysis with Scikit-Learn

This project showcases a complete linear regression workflow using the Boston Housing dataset. It involves data preprocessing, model training with Scikit-Learn, evaluation of model performance, and visualization of results.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to apply linear regression techniques to predict housing prices based on various features in the dataset. The model is evaluated using standard regression metrics and visualized for interpretability.

## Key Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Train-test data splitting
- Linear regression model training (sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression)
- Model evaluation using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Coefficient of Determination (R² score)
- Visualization of regression results using Matplotlib

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the script:

python linear_regression.py



Results

The script will output key regression metrics and generate a plot showing the regression line fitted against the test data.
